## Brief
Based in Durango, Colorado, USA, Skyler and Finley own and operate Explorers
Southwest, a three season (March to October) “mild to mildly adventurous” tours
company. Their flagship and most popular offer — which started their business off in
2008 — was guided jeep tours to local “ghost mining towns” in the mountains
between the towns of Durango and Silverton. They also offer a fully guided tour to
Mesa Verde National Park one hour away.
They rent stand up paddle boards (SUP), fishing equipment, and kayaks to use at
nearby Lake Nighthorse.

### Ethos
Skyler and Finley were both born and raised in Colorado. Adventure sports are in
their blood. They also understand that they live in a location full of unique, sensitive
biodiversity. By taking tourists on guided tours they help reduce the footprint, boost
local economy, and keep non-locals off delicate ecosystems and restricted land.
They can provide a service for tourism while still preserving the delicate ecosystem
they live in.
They understand that not everyone is excited by adventure sports or extreme
adventures, and are targeting the market of “get outdoors” but might not be
comfortable with adrenaline extremes.
Because they both grew up in families who went out of doors from a young age,
they understand that providing a positive family vacation experience is vital for the
younger generation to learn to appreciate and explore the outside world.
They aren’t great at copywriting, but have provided you with some content about
what they have to offer. Perhaps you could also help them make their tours and
rentals even more interesting and attractive to their potential users?
